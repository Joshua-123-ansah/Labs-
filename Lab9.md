1) First we created a zero matrix with the function called zeroMatrix. 
2) The populateArray function takes the zero matrix and then populate it with numbers. Thus if a cell inside the matrix is undefined, a number 1 is assigned to that
cell. Otherwise the number inside the cell is increased by one. 
4) A printMatrix function was also created to help in printing the matrix when the need be. 
5) After populating the matrix with some numbers, the searchValidEntries given a boundary is used to print out numbers in cells containing 
value as well as their points . 
7) The main method is used to call the searchValidEntries function five times to print numbers within certain regions specified by the search function.
