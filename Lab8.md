A struct was created to help get the row and column position when creating the  InverseIdx function. 
A zero multidimentional array was created of which its lower dimentional part will be populated using the function multiArray. 
A function called printMultiArray which takes an int and a multidimentional array as parameters was used for printing all multidimentional array. Now the int 
which is size was used for looping through the multidimentional array. 
A function called linearIndx was also created. It takes the two numbers that makes a cell in the matrix and return an index value which is used as an index for 
element taken from the matrix cells into a single array. 
A printArray function was also created to print the single array. 
A inverseIdx was also created to help take element from the single array into the multidimentional array. 
Finally, a major function was created to call the function created above. The major function is the only function that is called inside the main function. 
This is because when it called, it calls all the other functions.
